 Sleep habits of New Yorkers. New York is known as “the city that never sleeps”. A random sample
 of 25 New Yorkers were asked how much sleep they get per night. Statistical summaries of these data are
 shown below. The point estimate suggests New Yorkers sleep less than 8 hours a night on average. Is the
 result statistically significant?

 (a) Write the hypotheses in symbols and in words.
 (b) Check conditions, then calculate the test statistic, T, and the associated degrees of freedom.
 (c) Find and interpret the p-value in this context. Drawing a picture may be helpful.
 (d) What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test?
 (e) If you were to construct a 90% confidence interval that corresponded to this hypothesis test, would you
 expect 8 hours to be in the interval?
 7.8 Heights of adults. Researchers studying anthropometry collected body girth measurements and skele
tal diameter measurements, as well as age, weight, height and gender, for 507 physically active individuals.

 (a) What is the point estimate for the average height of active individuals? What about the median?
 (b) What is the point estimate for the standard deviation of the heights of active individuals? What about
 the IQR?
 (c) Is a person who is 1m 80cm (180 cm) tall considered unusually tall? And is a person who is 1m 55cm
 (155cm) considered unusually short? Explain your reasoning.
 (d) Theresearchers take another random sample of physically active individuals. Would you expect the mean
 and the standard deviation of this new sample to be the ones given above? Explain your reasoning.
 (e) The sample means obtained are point estimates for the mean height of all active individuals, if the
 sample of individuals is equivalent to a simple random sample. What measure do we use to quantify the
 variability of such an estimate? Compute this quantity using the data from the original sample under
 the condition that the data are a simple random sample.
 7.9 Find the mean. You are given the following hypotheses:
 H0 : µ =60
 HA : µ=60
 We know that the sample standard deviation is 8 and the sample size is 20. For what sample mean would
 the p-value be equal to 0.05? Assume that all conditions necessary for inference are satisfied.

 7.10 t⋆ vs. z⋆. For a given confidence level, t⋆
 df is larger than z⋆. Explain how t∗
 df being slightly larger
 than z∗ affects the width of the confidence interval.
 7.11 Play the piano. Georgianna claims that in a small city renowned for its music school, the average
 child takes less than 5 years of piano lessons. We have a random sample of 20 children from the city, with a
 mean of 4.6 years of piano lessons and a standard deviation of 2.2 years.
 (a) Evaluate Georgianna’s claim (or that the opposite might be true) using a hypothesis test.
 (b) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the number of years students in this city take piano lessons, and
 interpret it in context of the data.
 (c) Do your results from the hypothesis test and the confidence interval agree? Explain your reasoning.
 7.12 Autoexhaustandleadexposure. Researchers interested in lead exposure due to car exhaust sampled
 the blood of 52 police officers subjected to constant inhalation of automobile exhaust fumes while working
 traffic enforcement in a primarily urban environment. The blood samples of these officers had an average
 lead concentration of 124.32 µg/l and a SD of 37.74 µg/l; a previous study of individuals from a nearby
 suburb, with no history of exposure, found an average blood level concentration of 35 µg/l.9
 (a) Write down the hypotheses that would be appropriate for testing if the police officers appear to have
 been exposed to a different concentration of lead.
 (b) Explicitly state and check all conditions necessary for inference on these data.
 (c) Regardless of your answers in part (b), test the hypothesis that the downtown police officers have a
 higher lead exposure than the group in the previous study. Interpret your results in context.
 7.13 Car insurance savings. A market researcher wants to evaluate car insurance savings at a competing
 company. Based on past studies he is assuming that the standard deviation of savings is $100. He wants
 to collect data such that he can get a margin of error of no more than $10 at a 95% confidence level. How
 large of a sample should he collect?
